# 🧾 Personal Expense Tracker (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This is a **console-based Personal Expense Tracker** built using Python.  
It allows users to **add, view, edit, delete, and summarize expenses** easily from the terminal.  
All data is stored permanently in a **CSV file**, making it simple yet powerful for daily use.

## ⚙️ What I Have Done  
- Designed a **menu-driven application** for expense management.  
- Implemented features like **Add**, **View**, **Edit**, **Delete**, and **Export**.  
- Used **CSV file handling** to save and manage records.  
- Added **input validation** for amount and date.  
- Provided **summaries** by category and date range.
